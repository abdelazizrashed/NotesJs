<a href="https://notesjs-api-ujriwdwoqa-nw.a.run.app/api/"> Notes.js </a> is a simple CRUD API built with NestJS.
</p>

## Description

The Note.js API represents a fundamental yet robust implementation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. 
Serving as a testament to my adeptness in backend web development, this project underscores my versatility with various technologies. 
It encompasses all essential components that one would expect in a production-ready Backend API. 
Notably, to accomplish this, I acquired proficiency in NestJS and TypeScript, reinforcing my commitment to continuous learning and adapting to new technologies in pursuit of excellence in backend development.
